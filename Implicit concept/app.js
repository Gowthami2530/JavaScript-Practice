//Implicit concept
// Implicit is a Type Converter

// Now we are giving the number in string and this Implicit will convert the string into number and it will give the result

let number1 = "10";
let number2 = "20";
let result = number1 - number2;
console.log(result);

// Now we have gave a number 
let number3 = 10;
let number4 = 20;
let result2 = number3 - number4;
console.log(result);

let number5 = 10;
let number6 = 20;
let result3 = number5 + number6;
console.log(result3);


// Now we will give the string and if we give + opeartion for the string it concatenation string 

let firstName = "Gowthami";
let secondName = "Akula";
let fullName = firstName +" "+secondName;
console.log(fullName);

// if we give the number as a string and if we give the + operation for the number and it will take the 
// number as a string and it concatenation the number and it will give the result
let number7 = "10";
let number8 = "20";
let result4 = number7 + number8;
console.log(result4);

// Now we will give the string and for those string we will give the mathematicl operation and it will not work for the string
// and it will give the result as NaN (NaN means it Not-a-Number)
let first = "gowthami";
let second = "akula";
let result1 = first - second;
console.log(result1);
