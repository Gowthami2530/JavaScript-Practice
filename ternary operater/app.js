// unary operater - typeof
let num = "Gowthami";
console.log(typeof num);
// binary operater - assigment 
let num1 = 2 + 5;
console.log(num1);
// ternary operater 
// condition ? (run if it is true) : (run if it is false)

let text = "Gowthami akula";

if(text){
    console.log(`hey it is have text it is true ${text}`);
}else{
    console.log("Its is not having the text so it is falsy value");
}

// now by using the ternary operater we can write the code like this the ternary operater are ? and : 

let text1 = "Akula gowthami";
text1 ? console.log(`hey it is have text it is true ${text1}`) : console.log("Its is not having the text so it is falsy value") ;

let text2 = "";
text2 ? console.log(`hey it is have text it is true ${text2}`) : console.log("Its is not having the text so it is falsy value") ;
